<h1 align="center"><b>E-Wallet App</b></h1>

## Getting Started
### Overview:
Welcome to the My App eWallet project. This is my first project that I created in Java by applying the concept of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

Ewallet app is a simple CLI-based application with the following features:
- Adding account data
- Create an ewallet
- Make transactions, in the form of top ups and transfers

### Tasks:
- Create a simple CLI-based application to accommodate the features above.
- Applying the OOP principles that I have learned in Java class.
